# Orion Framework
Orion originally started as a hobby project of one developer. Now there is a small team working on it and there are few applications already powered by Orion. The development started already in 2012, which is the reason of not using the latest technologies of these days.

Our goal is to help improve efficiency, mainly of development. Therefore we focus on:
* Saveing time of application development
* Improving final product quality
* Easy administration

Orion is based on Microsoft .NET Framework and related technologies. The minimal required versions of these technologies are:
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
* EntityFramework 6.1
* Microsoft ASP.NET
* Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
